LM158-N LM258-N LM2904-N LM358-N

SNOSBT3I – JANUARY 2000 – REVISED DECEMBER 2014

3 Description

The LM158 series consists of two independent, high
gain,
internally frequency compensated operational
amplifiers which were designed specifically to operate
from a single power supply over a wide range of
voltages. Operation from split power supplies is also
possible and the low power supply current drain is
independent of the magnitude of the power supply
voltage.
Application areas include transducer amplifiers, dc
gain blocks and all the conventional op-amp circuits
which now can be more easily implemented in single
power supply systems. For example,
the LM158
series can be directly operated off of the standard
3.3-V power supply voltage which is used in digital
systems and will easily provide the required interface
electronics without
requiring the additional ±15V
power supplies.
The LM358 and LM2904 are available in a chip sized
package (8-Bump DSBGA) using TI's DSBGA
package technology.
